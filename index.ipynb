    "\n",
    "Autoencoders are a clever way of training two models together than can compress an image (or other data) down into a roughly equivalent representation in a lower-dimensional space (the **_Encoder_**), and then reconstruct the original image from that lower-dimensional representation.  At their heart, they're a compression technique.  However, they're not a _good_ compression technique, because they are **_lossy_**, meaning that some of the compressed information will be lost during the process--in the case of images, we can interpret this as the image being a bit lower quality after running through the autoencoder.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Although autoencoders are not great at compression, they're still a useful tool in our Deep Learning toolbox, as they introduce us to the concept of **_Data Manifolds_**.  Although basic autoencoders aren't too useful, it turns out that more advanced versions of autoencoders have amazing uses for **_generative techniques_**, such as **_Denoising Autoencoders_** and **_Variational Autoencoders_**. Before we can learn to use the advanced methods, we'll need to get some practice and mastery with basic autoencoders.  \n",
